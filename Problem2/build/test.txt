TITLE="My Wonderful"
LYRICS="''A time when I was down and out
No lovin in my life
this angel came and brought about
a meaning of some right
Took my dark and lonely days
Into the light
With his loving ways

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Gotta have him close
to me
Each and every night
To give me that security
Of dreaming in delight
Love has got a grip on me
Oh so tight
Hope he never lets go

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Cause I don't ever want to be free
From this love and care that
most people will never see
And at night I pray
That I'll have my way
And enjoy love for eternity

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

No one can ever do for me
The things he does cause

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me''

TITLE="Just Because"
LYRICS="''Ah, remember this?
Why, I must have been thirteen when this came out!
Or was it fourteen?
Or was it twenty-two?
I could have been twelve actually.''

just because you left and said goodbye,
do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Just because I want someone who's kind,
with a heart as good and pure as mine.
But maybe I am asking for too much,
darling, please don't ever break my heart.

I know you think you're smart,
just runnin' around breaking lovers hearts.

Just because you left and said goodbye, hey!
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -

''this is doctor winston o'boggie saying goodnight
from record plant east, new york.
We hope you had a swell time!
Ev'rybody here says ''hi''.
Goodbye.''

just because you left and said goodbye,
do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so,
darling, I would rather let you go.

Uh-uh-uh -
goodbye!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh -
so long!
Been a long year!
